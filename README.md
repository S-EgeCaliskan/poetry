### Implementing the Poetry DB, created by <a href="https://github.com/thundercomb/poetrydb"> thundercomb </a>

<strong>Navigate through the code</strong>
<ul>
  <li>
    Custom hooks include the API calls made through search forms. FetchPoem is based on the titles of the poems, whereas the FetchPoet makes calls in relation to the author's name
  </li>
  <li>
    Components include the navigation bar, the home page, and poems/poem pages. I opted to keep poems and poem components separate to be able to make changes easier if need be.
  </li>
</ul>
<strong>Initial idea</strong>💡 <br/>
I wanted to get more projects done using React and practice using APIs, making HTTP requests and building a web page on that premise. I started looking for some open source databases and some spiked my interests (maybe I will also do some other projects with those), but as a great lover of poetry, I had to first create a project using this Poetry database.

## Takeaways 📝
I practiced:
  <ul>
    <li>API requests✔️</li>
    <li>React components (form/input &) and useState hook ✔️</li>
  </ul>

## TODOs
  <ul>
    <li>Add "About" and "Favourites"</li>
    <li>Make navigation better (back to the top?)</li>
    <del><li>Add another search functionality for individual poems</li></del> Done.
    <del><li>Display poems in a more presentable way? (for the author search)</li></del> Done.
  </ul>
