<strong>Initial idea</strong>💡 <br/>
I wanted to get more projects done using React and practice using APIs, making HTTP requests and building a web page on that premise. I started looking for some open source databases and some spiked my interests (maybe I will also do some other projects with those), but as a great lover of poetry, I had to first create a project using this Poetry database.

## Takeaways 📝
I practiced:
  <ul>
    <li>API requests✔️</li>
    <li>React components (form/input &.)✔️</li>
  </ul>

## TODOs
  <ul>
    <li>Make navigation better (back to the top?)</li>
    <li>Add another search functionality for individual poems</li>
    <li>Display poems in a more presentable way? (for the author search)</li>
  </ul>
